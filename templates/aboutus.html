            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We're a group of college students who realized that with the massive variety of current streaming platforms, 
                it was difficult to quickly find entertainment options without feeling overwhelmed. The goal of this tool is to make movie
                searching easier by letting you filter entertainment from different streaming services, or select random options if you're not sure what to pick.
