getMovie usage: main.py getMovie title
--After typing getMovie as the Feature, there's one command line argument representing the title of the desired movie, which should be entered with quotes--
for example, Bird Box would be searched as python3 main.py getMovie "Bird Box". 
The function returns a list of all the relevant film information stored by the dataset.

getRandomMovie usage: main.py getRandomMovie category1 descriptor1 category2 descriptor2 ... category12 descriptor12
--getRandomMovie requires at least 2 arguments and has a maximum of 12. The arguments are structured in pairs, with the first one
representing a category of the dataset: -t for title, -t for type(Movie or TV show), -g for genre, 
-d for director, -c for cast, -y for release year, or -r for rating. The second argument represents a value in the specified category.
The function returns a random movie out of the ones filtered by the command line requirements.

getPopularMovie usage: main.py getPopularMovie
--getPopularMovie has no command line arguments because it simply returns a list of the ten most popular movies, based on how frequently they've been searched on getMovie.
